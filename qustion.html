     2 .Difference between cookie vs local storage vs session storage ?
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>Ans-</strong>   SessionStorage is similar to localStorage .The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
     <br>
     Cookies are intended to be read by the server, whereas localStorage can only be read by the browser. Thus, cookies are restricted to small data volumes, while localStorage can store more data.

        3. What is event loop in JavaScript.How does it work?
      </h3>
      <p>
       <strong>Ans-</strong>

    Event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism through which the 'calls waiting for       execution' in the callback queue/job queue can be put on the call stack.
    The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks.
